(Q) Describe the main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model.When would you choose to use one over the other? 

ANS: Flexbox and Grid are two CSS layout models that can be used to create complex web application layouts with just a couple of CSS rules.

Let us  understand the differences between Flexbox and Grid CSS layout models and a recommendation on when to use one over the other.

Let’s start with learning how the Flexbox layout model works, then continue to how the Grid layout model works.

How CSS Flexbox layout works
The Flexbox (or Flexible Box) layout model is a one-dimensional CSS layout model that allows you to create responsive layouts for your web application.

The key feature of the Flexbox model is that it adjusts the layout of your web page automatically based on the size of your content. You only need to define the direction and the wrap behavior of the Flexbox with the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

The flexibility of the Flexbox model allows you to distribute unused space between elements that are vertically or horizontally aligned.


How CSS Grid layout works
The CSS Grid layout allows you to create a two-dimensional layout model that is made of rows and columns. It allows you to create a much more rigid layout for your web page that doesn’t change based on the content size.

To help you understand the difference between CSS Flexbox and Grid layout, let’s use the same example above where you have one container element with five children elements.

As you already see above, the Flexbox model allows your content to shape the layout of the web page. If one of your items has a bigger size, then the entire layout would flex to accommodate the different sizes of the child elements.

But what if you want a strictly defined layout where each row has three columns no matter the size of the item?

The Flexbox model doesn’t have the properties to strictly control the layout of the items. To produce a row with three columns, you need to calculate the width of each child element yourself.
