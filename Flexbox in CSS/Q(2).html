<!--(Q) Explain the role of the following key properties in the flexbox layout model
1.justify-content
2.align-items
3.gap
4.flex-direction
5.flex-wrap

ANS: (a)-> justify content

It defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.

The justify-content property accepts five different values:

flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start line
flex-end: items are packed toward to end line
center: items are centered along the line
space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them
space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent alignment subjects, before the first alignment subject, and after the last alignment subject is the same


(b)-> Align items
The align-items property is related to CSS layout. It effects how elements are aligned both in Flexbox and Grid layouts. The align-items property defines the default behavior for how items are laid out along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis). Imagine a horizontal flexbox layout.

(c)-> gap
The gap property in CSS is a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap, specifying the size of gutters, which is the space between rows and columns within grid, flex, and multi-column layouts. Use the slider in the demo below to see the gap property in action: A single value sets both row-gap and column-gap by the same value.

(d)->Flex-direction
  The flex-direction CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed). Note that the values row and row-reverse are affected by the directionality of the flex container.

  (e)-> Flex-wrap
  The CSS flex-wrap property is used to specify whether flex items are forced into a single line or wrapped onto multiple lines. The flex-wrap property allows enabling the control direction in which lines are stacked. It is used to designate a single line or multi-line format to flex items inside the flex container.
